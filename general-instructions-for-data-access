#### Access to machines in Naples: ####

To be able to access, you must connect from one of the MURAVES institutes (INFN Naples, Louvain-la-Neuve, Gent, VUB); if connecting from elsewhere, first use a VPN to tunnel through your institute's network.

ssh -XY -l [your username] 192.84.134.230 -p 65022 -o ServerAliveInterval=100

DQM scripts are available here:
/media/muraves2/DataQualityMonitor

Note: only few MURAVES members have writing permissions in the MURAVES directories. Therefore, first copy the scripts in your home directory.

#### Access to machines at VUB: ####

https://t2bwiki.iihe.ac.be/First_access_to_t2b
https://t2bwiki.iihe.ac.be/Cluster_Overview

ssh -Y -i ~/.ssh/[name of your id_rsa file] -o ServerAliveInterval=100 [your username]@mshort.iihe.ac.be
(to access specific nodes of the cluster, replace mshort with m1,m2,m3, etc.)

Path to the raw data files copied from muripper pc:
/pnfs/iihe/muraves/muraves_DATA/VESUVIO/RAW/

#### Timestamp information: ####

RAW data files contain timestamps at the beginning of the run, at its end, and for each event.
These timestamps are reliable for start/end of run, but because of a bug they have an offset in the event-level information. Time differences between events are reliable, though.

#### Baseline analysis procedure: ####

Data in gzip format must be strored in the directory /pnfs/iihe/muraves/muraves_DATA/VESUVIO/RAW/<color> divided by detector name (color). In the subdir VESUVIO/SOFTWARE you can find the parsing tool.

Proceed coping the python scripts in the SOFTWARE directory inside your home dir (mine is /user/cimmino/), both PaP_gzip.py and evtParserGP.py. In the same directory, create the VESUVIO dir with 2 sub folders RAW and datiVesuvio. Inside each of them, create the detector directories ROSSO, NERO and BLU


VESUVIO    --->     RAW               --->    ROSSO

                                                       --->    NERO

                                                       --->    BLU

                    --->    datiVesuvio    --->    ROSSO

                                                       --->    NERO

                                                       --->    BLU

Copy the gzipped files from the shared RAW dir to your own private RAW dir, respecting color and run the parser using

python3 PaP_gzip.py <runInit> <runEnd> 5 10000 4 10000 16 <color>

this produces inside the directory VESUVIO/datiVesuvio/<color>, a LOG file, add CONTEGGI_run... and SLOWCONTROL_run... to the files CONTEGGI_<color>.txt and SLOWCONTROL_<color>.txt, and translate the raw files pedData and slaveData to the files PED_run... and ACQ_run... that can be analyzed.

The PED and ACQ files format is:

globalTriggerNumber    16x[masterboardTriggerNumber    boardNumber    32 fields ADC counts for each SiPM    relativeTimestamp    measuredTimeExpandedCounts   n/a   channelsInvolved]

The main time information are in the name of the file, i.e. ADC_run14902_20220915_132123.txt is the ADC file of the run number 14902 took at 13:21:23 on 2022, 15 September.
