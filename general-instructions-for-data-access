#### Access to machines in Naples: ####

To be able to access, you must connect from one of the MURAVES institutes (INFN Naples, Louvain-la-Neuve, Gent, VUB); if connecting from elsewhere, first use a VPN to tunnel through your institute's network.

ssh -XY -l [your username] 192.84.134.230 -p 65022 -o ServerAliveInterval=100

DQM scripts are available here:
/media/muraves2/DataQualityMonitor

Note: only few MURAVES members have writing permissions in the MURAVES directories. Therefore, first copy the scripts in your home directory.

#### Access to machines at VUB: ####

https://t2bwiki.iihe.ac.be/First_access_to_t2b
https://t2bwiki.iihe.ac.be/Cluster_Overview

ssh -Y -i ~/.ssh/[name of your id_rsa file] -o ServerAliveInterval=100 [your username]@mshort.iihe.ac.be
(to access specific nodes of the cluster, replace mshort with m1,m2,m3, etc.)

Path to the raw data files copied from muripper pc:
/pnfs/iihe/muraves/muraves_DATA/VESUVIO/RAW/

#### Timestamp information: ####

RAW data files contain timestamps at the beginning of the run, at its end, and for each event.
These timestamps are reliable for start/end of run, but because of a bug they have an offset in the event-level information. Time differences between events are reliable, though.
