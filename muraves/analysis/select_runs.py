Select the list of good runs for a given hodoscope, applying the agreed quality criteria.

Criteria (in the order they are applied):

  1. Raw run must exist            -> 'missing_run == False'  ("subruns" is an empty list
                                      when the raw files were not found)
  2. All sub-runs present          -> number of subruns == N_SUBRUNS_REQUIRED
                                      (NOT AVAILABLE in the current pkl files, see note below)
  3. Parsing succeeded             -> 'is_run_ok == True'     ("status": "ok")
  4. Missing/shifted bit frequency -> mismatch test passed AND mismatch_prob < MISMATCH_PROB_MAX
                                      (same definition as dev/good_runs/good_runs_stat.py)
  5. Pedestal quality              -> number of affected channels <= MAX_AFFECTED_CHANNELS
                                      (from the pedestal deviation check summary)
  6. Accidental coincidences       -> accidental_rate == 0 (runs with accidental_rate > 0
                                      are excluded)
                                      (from the monitoring scan, data_scan_<color>.pkl)
  7. Trigger rate stability        -> median - N*sigma <= trigger_rate <= median + N*sigma,
                                      with N = TRIGGER_RATE_N_SIGMA (3) and sigma the ROBUST
                                      spread 1.4826*MAD, both computed on the runs that reach
                                      this cut. Applied LAST, so that the band is defined by
                                      the runs that are already good for every other reason.

NOTE on criterion 7: the standard deviation cannot be used here, because it is dominated by
the very runs the cut has to reject. For BLU about one run in five reports a trigger_rate of
O(5e5) Hz: the standard deviation then reaches 1.6e5 Hz against a median of 13 Hz, the band
covers the whole sample and its lower edge is negative, so a run with an abnormally LOW rate
can never be rejected. The median absolute deviation is built from medians, so those runs
cannot move it; 1.4826*MAD is the same number as the standard deviation for a gaussian sample,
which keeps the "median +/- N sigma" reading of the cut. N = 3 is used because the rate
distribution is a narrow core with long tails: at N = 1 the cut would throw away a third to a
half of perfectly good runs, while N = 3 reproduces the usual Tukey outlier fences.

The sample the band is computed on needs no cleaning: those O(5e5) Hz runs all have accidental
coincidences, so criterion 6 removes them before this cut ever sees them.

NOTE on criterion 2: 'read_summary_file' in muraves_lib.run_manager only exposes
'missing_run' (len(subruns) == 0), not the actual number of subruns, so the df_overview pkl
files do not carry that information. The cut is implemented but is skipped with
a warning unless the dataframe has a subrun-count column (see N_SUBRUNS_COLUMNS). To enable
it: add the subrun count to RunValidation/read_summary_file and regenerate the pkl files.

Inputs, all under DATA_PATH (/pnfs/iihe/muraves/muraves_DATA, --data-path to change it).
<version_parsing> and <version_pedestal> are the processing versions of the two production
steps and advance independently (--version-parsing, --version-pedestal):
  - PARSED/<COLOR>/<version_parsing>/df_overview_<COLOR>_<version_parsing>.pkl
        (built with read_summary_file)
  - PEDESTAL/<COLOR>/<version_pedestal>/<COLOR>/pedestal_deviation_check/
        <COLOR>_HISTchi2_outliers_SUMMARY.txt
  - RAW_GZ/<COLOR>/data_scan_<color>.pkl   (trigger rate, accidental rate, working point)

Output:
  - <COLOR>_type<TYPE>_SELECTED_RUNS.txt : one run number per line
  - <COLOR>_type<TYPE>_SELECTION_CUTFLOW.pdf : pie chart of the cut flow (--no-plot to skip)
  - <COLOR>_type<TYPE>_ACCIDENTAL_RATE_SELECTED.pdf : trigger rate vs run for the runs
        reaching criterion 6 (the survivors of criteria 1-5), split into the ones it keeps
        and the ones it rejects (accidental_rate > 0); no trigger rate band is drawn
  - <COLOR>_type<TYPE>_TRIGGER_RATE_SELECTED.pdf : trigger rate vs run for the runs reaching
        criterion 7, split into the selected ones and the ones the band rejects
  - optional csv with the per-run quantities used for the selection (--details)
